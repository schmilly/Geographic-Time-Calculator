# Geographic-Time-Calculator
By the one and only, Schmilly!

The Essential purpose of this program is to calculate your time based on "Geographic Time* What this means is that it esentially divides the world up into 1440 sections (60*24) for every minute in the day, with your current time being offset from the time at UTC.

Kind of a silly program, that I made when I was a kid, did some minor changes to try and fix it up, but apart from that should run if you put it through a python compiler. Only tested on Linux, could work on windows but I haven't and won't check. 

Definetly is a mess of terrible code but it was written by a literal child so you know take that as you will.
